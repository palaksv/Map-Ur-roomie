#  Map-Ur-Roomie 
> This is a website where you can view the details of your roommates beforehand and book the hostel room according to your preferences.




##  Project Workflow

> First the student has to register on the website using his email-id and password, after which he needs to complete his profile and then login using the same credentials. After logging in, there are provisions of maps and a chatbot for simple queries regarding hostel. The user can navigate through the 3 floors and check the rooms available. The details of the person already staying in the room open up when you click on the name of the person.
If you want to book the room, there is a contact us option on the homepage which will direct you to the phone number and email id of the management.

>* Implementing SMS service on the registered mobile number
